This is a simple memory game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to test and improve my JavaScript skills. The game challenges players to find matching pairs of cards from a shuffled deck.

Features

Flip Animation: Cards flip smoothly when clicked, revealing their content.

Restart Option: Players can restart the game at any time.

How to Play?
Click on any card to flip it over.
Click on another card to find its matching pair.
If the cards match, they will remain face-up. If not, they will flip back after a short delay.
Continue flipping cards to find all the matching pairs.
The game ends when all pairs are found.
